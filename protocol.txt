===Small protocol definition for clipshare===

1. A dispatcher (separate thread) has a socket for incoming broadcast connections
on which it waits for a CSHELO message from other clients

2. Upon receiving said message, the dispatcher creates a ClipboardServer and 
ClipboardClient instance (also threads), using the received IP address and port

3. It also broadcasts its own CSHELO message, to make sure the new client is 
aware of the locally running client

4. After that, the server and client instances take care of sending and receiving
changes to the clipboard
